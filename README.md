# Pong
This will be a repository of Pong games that I create.

**2020_06_21_PongGame.html** This is a Pong game that I made with a tutorial from Udemy ("Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in Javascript on Canvas"). It follows the tutorial strictly. It uses HTML and Javascript. It was coded just using a .txt file; it wasn't coded using a text editor like Brackets or Visual Studio. It is mildly commented; not as well commented as I would like but this was my first try making a Pong game and I just wanted to follow the tutorial exactly. If I make revised versions in the future, then they will definitely be commented better.
