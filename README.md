# Pong
This will be a repository of Pong games that I create.

This is a Pong game that I made with a tutorial from Udemy ("Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in Javascript on Canvas"). It follows the tutorial strictly. It uses HTML and Javascript. It was coded just using a .txt file; it wasn't coded using a text editor like Brackets or Visual Studio. It is mildly commented; not as well commented as I would like but this was my first try making a Pong game and I just wanted to follow the tutorial exactly. If I make revised versions in the future, then they will definitely be commented better. This Pong game is slightly glitchy; for some reason, there is a chance that if the ball hits the farther from the center parts of the players paddle, the game will register that the ball hit the wall and give a point to the AI paddle. I don't yet understand why this happens.
