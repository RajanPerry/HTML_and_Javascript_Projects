# Pong
This is a repository of a Pong game that I made.

**2020_06_21_PongGame.html** 

This is a Pong game that I made with a tutorial from Udemy ("Code Your First Game: Arcade Classic in Javascript on Canvas"). It follows the tutorial strictly. It uses HTML and Javascript. It was coded just using a .txt file; it wasn't coded using a text editor like Brackets or Visual Studio.
